# Chocochip #

Features/Fixes I intend to address in the _chocochip_ release.

  * ~~Propagate error messages from upstream providers back to client~~
  * ~~memcache responses~~
  * ~~Set proper http expires headers in response~~
  * ~~update slideshare provider to v2 api~~
  * add new providers where feasible: ~~dailymotion~~, ~~blip.tv~~, revver, laconica, ~~phodroid.com~~, vzaar.com, ~~scribd~~
  * hopefully bring back imdb provider
  * ~~add crossdomain.xml~~

Striked out items are done!
